Blackjack simulation for a college project that outputs stats on millions of runs of the simulation.
Used only for research purposes.  Apologies for the slightly sloppy code.  One of my first projects.

This project is run from Eclipse.  The BlackjackDistribution java code will run the whole simulation.
It takes TWO arguments, numberRuns and numberDecks.  These specifiy the number of runs of 1,000,000
simulated hands of blackjack EACH and the number of decks used in each one.  The number of decks was
a variable that was used in the research analysis.  There is no GUI for this project, sorry.

The simulation can contain CardCounter players as well as normal BasicStrategy players.  The project
was attempting to see how well CardCounters did with certain parameters set.
